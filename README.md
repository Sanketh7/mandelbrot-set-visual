# mandelbrot-set-visual

Draws a portion of the Mandelbrot Set based on user input. Originally created to expedite my Algebra II Honors Mandelbrot Set Project.



## Usage

1. Make sure you have python 3.x installed (will not work with python 2.x)

2. If you are using Linux, run the following in your computer's terminal to install Tkinter (used for graphics):

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk
   ```

3. To run the program, type the following in your computer's terminal/cmd/Powershell:

   ```
   python mandel.py
   ```

   If `tkinter` cannot be found when you try to run it, this is because `python` in your system's PATH is set to python 2.x. Run the command above but replace `python` with the phrase that corresponds to python 3.x in your PATH (make sure to add it if it's not there already).
